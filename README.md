# launch-simulator
SLAS Console: Fictional launch simulator (HTML). Authorize launch via three critical steps: secret keycode (1379), arming switch, and a pre-launch system check delay. Features include custom target input, responsive dark sci-fi UI, and dramatic Tone.js sound effects for authorization, countdown, and lift-off. Fully replayable with a restart option.
